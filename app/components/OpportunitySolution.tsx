            The Opportunity
          </h2>
          <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
            Africa faces a dual challenge: rapid urbanization and a growing
            waste crisis. Traditional waste management systems are overwhelmed,
            leading to environmental degradation, health risks, and missed
            economic opportunities. However, within this challenge lies a
            significant opportunity. By reimagining waste as a resource, we can
            unlock its potential to create jobs, generate clean energy, and
            build resilient communities.

            Our Solution â€” A Climate-Smart Circular Model
          </h2>
          <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
            Waste Grid champions a circular economy approach, where materials
            are kept in use for as long as possible. Our model focuses on
            reducing waste generation, promoting reuse and recycling, and
            transforming residual waste into valuable products and energy. This
            integrated approach not only minimizes environmental impact but also
            creates new economic opportunities and strengthens community
            resilience.
